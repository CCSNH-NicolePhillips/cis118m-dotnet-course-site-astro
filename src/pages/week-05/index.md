# Week 5

**Focus:** Loops: making the computer repeat steps (while + for).

## This week’s pages
- Lesson 1: [./lesson-1/](./lesson-1/) — <span data-progress-slug="lesson-1"></span>
- Lesson 2: [./lesson-2/](./lesson-2/) — <span data-progress-slug="lesson-2"></span>
- Extra practice: [./extra-practice/](./extra-practice/) — <span data-progress-slug="extra-practice"></span>
- Lab: [./lab/](./lab/) — <span data-progress-slug="lab" data-progress-kind="selfMarked"></span>
- Homework: [./homework/](./homework/) — <span data-progress-slug="homework" data-progress-kind="selfMarked"></span>

## By the end of this week, you can:
- Write a `while` loop that repeats until a condition becomes false
- Write a `for` loop that counts up or down
- Avoid infinite loops by updating your loop variable
