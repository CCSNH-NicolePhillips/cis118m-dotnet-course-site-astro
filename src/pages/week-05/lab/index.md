# Week 5 Lab: Input Retry Loop + Number Game

## Overview
Build a small program that keeps asking until the user enters a valid number, then plays a simple guessing or counting game.

## Requirements checklist (acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Uses a loop (while is recommended) to re-prompt on invalid input
- [ ] Uses TryParse to validate a whole number
- [ ] Has at least one rule (example: number must be between 1 and 10)
- [ ] Prints friendly messages for invalid input and success
- [ ] Runs without errors

## Submit to Canvas
- Submit code (paste/export)
- Submit screenshot of output showing at least one invalid attempt and one valid attempt

## Open in Editor
- Start here: `/editor/?week=05&starter=week-05-lesson-1`
