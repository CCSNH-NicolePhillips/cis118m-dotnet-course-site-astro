# Week 1: Start Here

**Total Time: ~60 minutes**

Welcome to CIS 118M: Introduction to C# Programming! This page will get you oriented and ready to succeed in this course.

---

## Welcome + How This Course Works (10 min)

This is a **fully online, self-paced course**. Everything happens right here on this site — no external tools required (except Canvas for final grades).

### What Makes This Course Different

- **Code runs in your browser** — No software to install
- **Instant feedback** — Try code and see results immediately  
- **Self-contained modules** — Each week is complete with lessons, practice, and assignments
- **Real-time progress tracking** — See what you've completed at a glance

### Weekly Structure

Each week follows the same pattern:

1. **Lessons** — Learn new concepts with examples
2. **Try It Now** — Write and run code inline (no leaving the page!)
3. **Extra Practice** — Reinforce what you learned
4. **Checkpoint Quiz** — Test your understanding (auto-graded)
5. **Lab** — Build something (graded assignment)
6. **Homework** — Small reflection or extension

## Syllabus (10 min)

### Course Overview

**CIS 118M** teaches you to program in C# using the .NET platform. You'll start with simple console programs and progress to working with objects, methods, and data structures.

**Prerequisites:** None — we start from zero

### Grading Breakdown

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Quizzes** | 30% | Weekly checkpoint quizzes (auto-graded, can retake) |
| **Labs** | 50% | Hands-on coding assignments (graded for correctness + requirements) |
| **Final Project** | 20% | Capstone project at end of semester |

**Passing grade:** 70% (C or higher)

### Late Work Policy

- **Quizzes:** No late submissions (but you can retake until the due date)
- **Labs:** 10% penalty per day late (up to 3 days max)
- **Final Project:** No late submissions

### Academic Integrity

You **must** write your own code. You may:
- Use course materials and examples
- Ask for help in office hours
- Collaborate on understanding concepts

You **may not**:
- Copy code from other students
- Use AI tools to write code (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
- Submit work you didn't write

Violations = zero on assignment and possible course failure.

## How to Get Help + Expectations (10 min)

### You WILL Get Stuck — That's Normal!

Programming is hard at first. Everyone gets stuck. Here's how to get unstuck:

### What to Include When Asking for Help

Always provide:

1. **Screenshot** of your code and error
2. **Starter ID** (e.g., "week-01-lesson-1")
3. **What you tried** and what happened
4. **The exact error message** (copy/paste it)

**Good help request:**
> "I'm working on week-01-lesson-2 and getting error 'CS1002: ; expected' on line 8. I added a semicolon but still getting the error. [Screenshot attached]"

**Bad help request:**
> "My code doesn't work. Help!"

### Where to Ask

- **Canvas Discussion Board** — Best for course questions (I check daily)
- **Office Hours** — See Canvas for times
- **Email** — For personal/grade questions only

### Response Time

- Discussion posts: Within 24 hours (usually faster)
- Email: Within 48 hours
- Emergency? Call/text (see Canvas for number)

## How Grading Works (10 min)

### What Gets Graded

**1. Checkpoint Quizzes (30%)**
- One per week
- Auto-graded (instant feedback)
- Can retake unlimited times until due date
- Best score counts

**2. Labs (50%)**
- One per week
- Graded on correctness + requirements + readability
- Must run without errors
- Partial credit available
- You can run checks before submitting

**3. Final Project (20%)**
- Cumulative project due at end of semester
- Combines everything you learned
- Graded with detailed rubric

### How Labs Are Graded

Labs use this rubric:

| Component | Points | What It Means |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Correctness** | 60% | Does it run? Does it produce the right output? |
| **Requirements** | 20% | Did you meet all stated requirements? |
| **Readability** | 10% | Is code well-formatted with good variable names? |
| **Submission** | 10% | Did you submit correctly and on time? |

**Pro tip:** Run the **Checks** button before submitting labs — it tells you if you're missing requirements.

### Grading Timeline

- **Quizzes:** Instant (auto-graded)
- **Labs:** Within 1 week of submission
- **Final Project:** Within 2 weeks of semester end
