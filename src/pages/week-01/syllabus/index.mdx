## Course Description

This course introduces students to programming using the C# language and the .NET platform. Students will learn fundamental programming concepts including variables, data types, control structures, methods, arrays, and object-oriented programming basics. All coursework is completed through an integrated online platform with no software installation required.

## Instructor Information

**Instructor:** [To be updated by faculty]  
**Email:** [To be updated by faculty]  
**Office Hours:** [To be updated by faculty]

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Write, compile, and run C# console applications
2. Use variables, data types, and operators correctly
3. Implement control structures (if/else, loops, switch)
4. Create and call methods with parameters and return values
5. Work with arrays and collections
6. Apply basic object-oriented programming concepts (classes, objects, properties)
7. Debug code and interpret error messages
8. Write clean, readable, well-commented code

## Required Materials

**No textbook or software purchases required!**

All course materials are provided on this website, and the code editor runs in your browser.

**Required:**
- Computer with reliable internet connection
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari)
- Canvas account (for grades and announcements)

## Course Structure

This course is organized into **16 weekly modules**, each containing:

- **Lessons** — Core content with examples and interactive code
- **Extra Practice** — Optional drills (highly recommended)
- **Checkpoint Quiz** — Auto-graded quiz testing your understanding
- **Lab** — Hands-on coding assignment

**Expected time commitment:** 3-4 hours per week

### Grading Scale

| Letter Grade | Percentage |
|--------------|------------|
| A | 90-100% |
| B | 80-89% |
| C | 70-79% |
| D | 60-69% |
| F | Below 60% |

**Passing grade:** C or higher (70%)

## Course Policies

### Attendance & Participation

This is a self-paced online course with **no required meeting times**. However, you must:

- Complete all assignments by their due dates
- Respond to instructor emails within 24-48 hours
- Check Canvas announcements weekly

### Late Work

- **Quizzes:** Can be retaken until the due date (no late submissions)
- **Labs:** 10% penalty per day late (up to 3 days; after that, 0 points)
- **Final Project:** No late submissions accepted

**Extensions:** Contact the instructor BEFORE the due date if you need an extension due to documented emergency or illness.

### Academic Integrity

All work submitted must be your own. You may:

- Use course materials and examples
- Ask for help in office hours or discussion boards
- Collaborate on understanding concepts

You may NOT:

- Copy code from other students
- Use AI tools to write your code (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.)
- Submit work that you did not write yourself

**Violations will result in a zero on the assignment and may lead to course failure or disciplinary action.**

### Accessibility

If you have a documented disability and need accommodations, please contact the college's Disability Services office and provide documentation to the instructor as early as possible.

### Technical Support

**Course website issues:** Contact instructor  
**Canvas issues:** Contact Canvas support  
**Computer/internet issues:** Visit campus computer lab or library

## Weekly Schedule

Each week follows this pattern:

| Day | What to Do |
|-----|------------|
| **Monday** | New module opens — read overview and start lessons |
| **Tuesday-Thursday** | Complete lessons, extra practice, and checkpoint quiz |
| **Friday-Sunday** | Work on lab assignment |
| **Sunday 11:59 PM** | Quiz and lab due |

## How Labs Are Graded

Labs are graded using **automated checks** plus instructor review:

- **60% Correctness** — Does it run without errors? Does it produce the correct output?
- **20% Requirements** — Does it meet all stated requirements (variables, methods, etc.)?
- **10% Readability** — Is the code well-formatted with meaningful variable names?
- **10% Submission** — Did you submit it correctly and on time?

You can run checks in the editor BEFORE submitting to see if your code passes the automated tests.

## Tips for Success

✅ **Start early** — Don't wait until Sunday night!

✅ **Do the extra practice** — More practice = better understanding

✅ **Ask questions** — Use office hours and discussion boards

✅ **Type code yourself** — Don't copy/paste

✅ **Read error messages** — They tell you exactly what's wrong

✅ **Save often** — Use the "Save" button in the editor

## Important Dates

[To be updated by faculty based on semester]

- **Week 1:** Course introduction and C# basics
- **Week 8:** Midterm checkpoint (no exam, just progress review)
- **Week 16:** Final project due

## Getting Help

**Course Content Questions:**
- Post in Canvas discussion board (fastest response)
- Attend office hours
- Email instructor

**Technical Issues:**
- Email instructor with screenshots and error messages
- Include: starter ID, what you tried, exact error message

**Personal/Grade Questions:**
- Email instructor directly
