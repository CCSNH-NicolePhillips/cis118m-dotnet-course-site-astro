  questions={[
    {
      id: "q1",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is C# in the .NET ecosystem?",
      options: [
        "The execution engine that runs your code",
        "The programming language you write code in",
        "A database management system",
        "A web browser"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "The programming language you write code in",
      explanation: "C# is the programming language — the 'blueprint' you write. The CLR is the 'engine' that executes it."
    },
    {
      id: "q2",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What does the CLR (Common Language Runtime) do?",
      options: [
        "Checks your code for typos",
        "Executes your compiled code at runtime",
        "Designs the user interface",
        "Connects to the internet"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Executes your compiled code at runtime",
      explanation: "The CLR is the 'engine' that actually runs your compiled code. It manages memory, security, and execution."
    },
    {
      id: "q3",
      type: "true-false",
      question: "A missing semicolon in C# will cause a compile-time error, preventing the CLR from ever running the code.",
      correctAnswer: "True",
      explanation: "Correct! The compiler catches syntax errors like missing semicolons BEFORE the CLR ever sees your code."
    },
    {
      id: "q4",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is the purpose of Console.WriteLine()?",
      options: [
        "To read input from the user",
        "To display output to the terminal/console",
        "To save data to a file",
        "To connect to a database"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "To display output to the terminal/console",
      explanation: "Console.WriteLine() is your communication protocol — it sends messages to the terminal for the user to see."
    },
    {
      id: "q5",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "In the 'Blueprint vs Engine' analogy, what does the semicolon represent?",
      options: [
        "The engine's fuel",
        "A signal that one instruction is complete",
        "The blueprint's title",
        "A comment in the code"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "A signal that one instruction is complete",
      explanation: "The semicolon tells the compiler 'this statement is finished' — like a period at the end of a sentence."
