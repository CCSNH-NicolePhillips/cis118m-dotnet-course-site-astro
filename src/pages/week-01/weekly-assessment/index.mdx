  questions={[
    {
      id: "q1",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is C# in the .NET ecosystem?",
      options: [
        "The execution engine that runs your code",
        "The programming language you write code in",
        "A database management system",
        "A web browser"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "The programming language you write code in",
      explanation: "C# is the programming language — the 'blueprint' you write. The CLR is the 'engine' that executes it."
    },
    {
      id: "q2",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What does the CLR (Common Language Runtime) do?",
      options: [
        "Checks your code for typos",
        "Executes your compiled code at runtime",
        "Designs the user interface",
        "Connects to the internet"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Executes your compiled code at runtime",
      explanation: "The CLR is the 'engine' that actually runs your compiled code. It manages memory, security, and execution."
    },
    {
      id: "q3",
      type: "true-false",
      question: "A missing semicolon in C# will cause a compile-time error, preventing the CLR from ever running the code.",
      correctAnswer: "True",
      explanation: "Correct! The compiler catches syntax errors like missing semicolons BEFORE the CLR ever sees your code."
    },
    {
      id: "q4",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is the purpose of Console.WriteLine()?",
      options: [
        "To read input from the user",
        "To display output to the terminal/console",
        "To save data to a file",
        "To connect to a database"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "To display output to the terminal/console",
      explanation: "Console.WriteLine() is your communication protocol — it sends messages to the terminal for the user to see."
    },
    {
      id: "q5",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "In the 'Blueprint vs Engine' analogy, what does the semicolon represent?",
      options: [
        "The engine's fuel",
        "A signal that one instruction is complete",
        "The blueprint's title",
        "A comment in the code"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "A signal that one instruction is complete",
      explanation: "The semicolon tells the compiler 'this statement is finished' — like a period at the end of a sentence."
    },
    {
      id: "q6",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What does the BCL (Base Class Library) provide?",
      options: [
        "The runtime engine that executes code",
        "Pre-built classes for common tasks like File I/O and Collections",
        "A code editor for writing C#",
        "Network hardware drivers"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Pre-built classes for common tasks like File I/O and Collections",
      explanation: "The BCL is your 'toolbox' — thousands of pre-built classes so you don't have to write everything from scratch."
    },
    {
      id: "q7",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What does the Roslyn compiler produce when it compiles your C# code?",
      options: [
        "Native machine code specific to your CPU",
        "Intermediate Language (IL) that any .NET runtime can execute",
        "HTML and CSS files",
        "A Docker container"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Intermediate Language (IL) that any .NET runtime can execute",
      explanation: "Roslyn compiles C# to IL (Intermediate Language). The JIT compiler then translates IL to native code at runtime."
    },
    {
      id: "q8",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "When does the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler run?",
      options: [
        "When you save your .cs file",
        "When Roslyn compiles your code",
        "At runtime, when the program actually executes",
        "When you install Visual Studio"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "At runtime, when the program actually executes",
      explanation: "The JIT compiler runs at execution time, translating IL to native machine code for your specific CPU."
    },
    {
      id: "q9",
      type: "true-false",
      question: "Console applications require a graphical user interface (GUI) to run.",
      correctAnswer: "False",
      explanation: "Console applications run in a terminal/command line — no GUI required. They're lightweight and great for learning."
    },
    {
      id: "q10",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is wrong with this code: Console.WriteLine(Hello World);",
      options: [
        "Console should be lowercase",
        "Missing double quotes around the text",
        "WriteLine is spelled incorrectly",
        "Missing a semicolon"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Missing double quotes around the text",
      explanation: "String literals (text) must be wrapped in double quotes: Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");"
    },
    {
      id: "q11",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Which email should you use for technical help in this course?",
      options: [
        "help@microsoft.com",
        "MCCCISOnline1@ccsnh.edu",
        "support@dotnet.org",
