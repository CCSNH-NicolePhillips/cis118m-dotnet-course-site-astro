# Week 1 Lesson 1: What is .NET vs C# + Hello World

**Time: 35 minutes**

## Goal
- Know what **.NET** is (the platform) and what **C#** is (the language)
- Understand what a **console app** does
- Write your first "Hello World" program
- Be able to explain this to a friend in 30 seconds

## Key Concepts

### C# (The Language)

**C#** (pronounced "see sharp") is the **programming language** you write. It's like English or Spanish — a way to communicate instructions.

Think of it like: **C# is the recipe you write.**

### .NET (The Platform)

**.NET** (pronounced "dot net") is the **platform that runs your C# code**. It includes:
- Tools to compile (translate) your code
- Libraries (pre-written code you can use)
- A runtime (the engine that executes your program)

Think of it like: **.NET is the kitchen and appliances that execute your recipe.**

### Console App

A **console app** is a program that runs in a text-based terminal. It:
- Prints text output to the screen
- Can accept text input from the user
- Is perfect for learning programming basics

Later you'll learn to make apps with windows, buttons, and graphics — but console apps teach the fundamentals.

## Your First Program: Hello World

Every programmer's first program prints "Hello World" to the screen. Let's try it!

<RunnableSnippet
  code={`using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, .NET!");
        Console.WriteLine("If you can read this, your program ran.");
    }
}`}
  starterId="week-01-lesson-1"
  height={200}
/>

**What's happening here?**

- `Console.WriteLine("text")` — Prints text to the console
- `"Hello, .NET!"` — The text to print (must be in quotes)
- `;` — Every statement ends with a semicolon

Don't worry about the other lines (`using System`, `class Program`, etc.) yet. We'll explain those later. For now, just focus on the `Console.WriteLine` lines.

## Try Me Now Tasks

Complete these three tasks to practice:

### Task 1: Run Hello World

<TryMeNow
  starterId="week-01-lesson-1"
  tasks={[
    "Click the 'Run' button",
    "Look at the console output (bottom panel)",
    "You should see two lines of text"
  ]}
  expectedOutput="Hello, .NET!\nIf you can read this, your program ran."
  tip="The output appears in the Console tab at the bottom. If nothing shows, check for error messages."
/>

### Task 2: Change the output to print 3 lines

<TryMeNow
  starterId="week-01-lesson-1"
  tasks={[
    "Change the first message to print your name",
    "Add a third Console.WriteLine that prints your favorite color",
    "Run the program again"
  ]}
  expectedOutput="Your Name\nIf you can read this, your program ran.\nMy favorite color is blue"
  tip="Copy one of the existing Console.WriteLine lines, paste it below, and change the text inside the quotes."
/>

### Task 3: Print a quote with quotation marks

**Challenge:** Print this exact message: `She said, "Hello!"`

The tricky part: The message itself has quotes inside it. How do you print quotes?

**Answer:** Use the **escape sequence** `\"`

<TryMeNow
  starterId="week-01-lesson-1"
  tasks={[
    "Add a new Console.WriteLine",
    "Use backslash-quote to put quotes inside your string",
    "Example: Console.WriteLine(\"She said, \\\"Hello!\\\"\");"
  ]}
  expectedOutput='She said, "Hello!"'
  tip="The backslash tells C# to treat the next character literally, not as code."
/>

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Missing quotes around text:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(Hello);  // ERROR
```

✅ **Correct:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello");  // WORKS
```

---

❌ **Missing semicolon:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello")  // ERROR
```

✅ **Correct:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello");  // WORKS
```

---

❌ **Typo in Console.WriteLine:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLin("Hello");  // ERROR (missing 'e')
```

✅ **Correct:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello");  // WORKS
```

## Mini-Check: Test Your Understanding

**1) Is .NET a programming language?**

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

**No.** C# is the language. .NET is the platform that runs C# programs.

</details>

**2) What does Console.WriteLine do?**

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

It prints a line of text (output) to the console.

</details>

**3) What's wrong with this code?**

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello)
```

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Two problems:
1. Missing closing quote after "Hello
2. Missing semicolon at the end

**Correct:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello");
```

</details>

## Comments (Notes for Humans)

You can add **comments** to explain what your code does. The computer ignores comments.

```csharp
// This is a single-line comment
Console.WriteLine("Hello");  // This prints Hello

/*
This is a multi-line comment.
You can write multiple lines here.
*/
```

**When to use comments:**
- Explain WHY you're doing something (not what — the code shows what)
- Mark sections of code
- Temporarily disable code (for testing)

**Pro tip:** Good code doesn't need many comments because the code itself is clear. Use comments for tricky parts.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **C#** is the programming language you write

✅ **.NET** is the platform that runs your C# code

✅ **Console apps** print text output to the terminal

✅ `Console.WriteLine("text")` prints a line

✅ Every statement ends with a **semicolon** `;`

✅ Text must be in **quotes** `"like this"`

✅ Use `\"` to print quotes inside a string

## Next Steps

Great job! You've written your first C# program. Now let's learn about:
