# Week 1 Lesson 1: .NET vs C# + Console Apps

**Time: 50 minutes**

## What You'll Learn

- What **.NET** is (the platform) and what **C#** is (the language)
- How C# code gets executed
- What a **console app** does
- Write your first "Hello World" program

---

## Understanding C#, .NET, and How They Work Together

        <p><strong>C#</strong> (pronounced "see sharp") is the <strong>programming language</strong> you write. It's the syntax and grammar you use to express instructions.</p>
        <p><strong>.NET</strong> (pronounced "dot net") is the <strong>platform</strong> that runs your C# code. It provides the tools, libraries, and runtime environment.</p>
        <h5>The Blueprint vs. Construction Site Analogy</h5>
        <p>Think of it this way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>C# is the blueprint</strong> — The detailed plan (your source code) that describes what to build</li>
          <li><strong>.NET is the construction site</strong> — The tools, materials, and workers (compiler, libraries, runtime) that execute your plan</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can't build a house with just a blueprint, and you can't run C# code without .NET. They work together.</p>

## Console Applications

A **console app** is a text-based program that runs in a terminal window. It:
- Prints text output to the screen
- Can accept text input from the user
- Has no graphical interface (no buttons, windows, etc.)

**Why start with console apps?**

They're the simplest way to learn programming fundamentals. Later you'll learn to build apps with graphics, but console apps let you focus on logic first.

---

## Your First Program: Hello World

Every programmer's first program prints "Hello, World!" to the screen. This tradition dates back to the 1970s. Let's continue it!

### Try It Now #1: Hello

<TryItNowRunner
  code={"using System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, world!\");\n    }\n}"}
  starterId="week-01-lesson-1-hello"
  height={180}
  instructions="Click Run to execute your first C# program!"
/>

**What's happening here?**

- `Console.WriteLine("text")` — Prints text to the console
- `"Hello, world!"` — The text to print (must be in quotes)
- `;` — Every statement ends with a semicolon

Don't worry about the other lines (`using System`, `class Program`, etc.) yet. We'll explain those later. For now, focus on the `Console.WriteLine` line.

---

## Adding Comments

**Comments** are notes for humans. The computer ignores them completely.

### Try It Now #2: Two Lines + Comment

<TryItNowRunner
  code={"using System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        // This is a comment (humans read it, computer ignores it)\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Line 1\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Line 2\");\n    }\n}"}
  starterId="week-01-lesson-1-comments"
  height={200}
  instructions="Run this code. Notice the comment line doesn't appear in the output."
/>

**Comment syntax:**

- `// Single line comment` — Everything after `//` on that line is ignored
- `/* Multi-line comment */` — Everything between `/*` and `*/` is ignored

**When to use comments:**
- Explain WHY you're doing something (not what—the code shows what)
- Mark sections of code
- Temporarily disable code for testing

---

## Your Turn: Customize It!

Now it's your turn to make changes.

### Try It Now #3: Change the Message

<TryItNowRunner
  code={"using System;\n\nclass Program\n{\n    static void Main()\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Change this message to your own words!\");\n    }\n}"}
  starterId="week-01-lesson-1-customize"
  height={180}
  instructions="Change the message to print your name or a fun fact about you. Then click Run!"
/>

**Challenges to try:**
1. Change the message to print your name
2. Add a second `Console.WriteLine` to print two lines
3. Add a comment above your code explaining what it does

## Common Mistakes (and how to fix them)

### Missing Quotes

❌ **Wrong:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine(Hello);  // ERROR
```

✅ **Correct:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello");  // WORKS
```

Text must always be in quotes!

---

### Missing Semicolon

❌ **Wrong:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello")  // ERROR
```

✅ **Correct:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello");  // WORKS
```

Every statement ends with a semicolon.

---

### Typos in Keywords

❌ **Wrong:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLin("Hello");  // ERROR (missing 'e')
```

✅ **Correct:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello");  // WORKS
```

Spelling matters! C# is case-sensitive.

---

## Key Takeaways

✅ **C#** is the programming language you write

✅ **.NET** is the platform that runs your C# code

✅ **Console apps** print text output to the terminal

✅ `Console.WriteLine("text")` prints a line

✅ Every statement ends with a **semicolon** `;`

✅ Text must be in **quotes** `"like this"`

✅ Comments start with `//` and are ignored by the computer

## Check Your Understanding

**1) Is .NET a programming language?**

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

**No.** C# is the language. .NET is the platform that runs C# programs.

</details>

**2) What does Console.WriteLine do?**

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

It prints a line of text (output) to the console.

</details>

**3) What's wrong with this code?**

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello)
```

<details>
<summary>Show answer</summary>

Two problems:
1. Missing closing quote after "Hello
2. Missing semicolon at the end

**Correct:**
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello");
```

</details>
