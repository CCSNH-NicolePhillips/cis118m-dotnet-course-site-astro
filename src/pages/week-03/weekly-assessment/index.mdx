  questions={[
    {
      id: "q1",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Which keyword makes a variable unchangeable after it is set?",
      options: [
        "static",
        "readonly",
        "const",
        "final"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "const",
      explanation: "The 'const' keyword creates a compile-time constant that cannot be modified after declaration."
    },
    {
      id: "q2",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is the default value of a bool if not initialized?",
      options: [
        "true",
        "false",
        "null",
        "0"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "false",
      explanation: "In C#, uninitialized boolean fields default to 'false'."
    },
    {
      id: "q3",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Which type is best for storing a single letter like 'A'?",
      options: [
        "string",
        "char",
        "int",
        "byte"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "char",
      explanation: "The 'char' type is specifically designed to store a single Unicode character."
    },
    {
      id: "q4",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Can an int store the value 10.5?",
      options: [
        "Yes, it stores as 10.5",
        "Yes, but it rounds to 10",
        "No, it causes a compiler error",
        "Yes, but only with a cast"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "No, it causes a compiler error",
      explanation: "An int cannot store decimal values. Attempting to assign 10.5 to an int causes a compiler error because of implicit conversion restrictions."
    },
    {
      id: "q5",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "In the line `int x = 5;`, what is 'x' called?",
      options: [
        "The type",
        "The identifier",
        "The value",
        "The assignment operator"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "The identifier",
      explanation: "The identifier is the name given to the variable. In this statement, 'int' is the type, 'x' is the identifier, '=' is the assignment operator, and '5' is the value."
    },
    {
      id: "q6",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Why should you use 'decimal' instead of 'double' for currency?",
      options: [
        "decimal is faster than double",
        "double cannot store negative numbers",
        "decimal avoids binary floating-point rounding errors",
        "double uses too much memory"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "decimal avoids binary floating-point rounding errors",
      explanation: "The decimal type uses base-10 internally, avoiding the rounding errors that occur with binary floating-point (double) when representing decimal fractions like 0.1."
    },
    {
      id: "q7",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What suffix is required when assigning a decimal literal?",
      options: [
        "d (e.g., 45.99d)",
        "f (e.g., 45.99f)",
        "m (e.g., 45.99m)",
        "No suffix required"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "m (e.g., 45.99m)",
      explanation: "The 'm' suffix tells C# that the number should be treated as a decimal type. Without it, 45.99 is interpreted as a double."
    },
    {
      id: "q8",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What does 'string immutability' mean?",
      options: [
        "Strings can only contain letters",
        "Strings cannot be created dynamically",
        "Strings cannot be changed after creation",
        "Strings must be uppercase"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Strings cannot be changed after creation",
      explanation: "Immutability means once a string object is created in memory, it cannot be modified. Any operation that appears to change a string actually creates a new string."
    },
    {
      id: "q9",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Which variable name is INVALID in C#?",
      options: [
        "_count",
        "userName",
        "2ndAttempt",
        "MAX_VALUE"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "2ndAttempt",
      explanation: "Variable names cannot start with a number. '2ndAttempt' would cause a compiler error. Valid alternatives include 'secondAttempt' or '_2ndAttempt'."
    },
    {
      id: "q10",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is the difference between declaration and initialization?",
      options: [
        "They are the same thing",
        "Declaration reserves memory; initialization assigns a value",
        "Initialization reserves memory; declaration assigns a value",
        "Declaration is for strings; initialization is for numbers"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Declaration reserves memory; initialization assigns a value",
      explanation: "Declaration creates the variable and reserves memory (like reserving a parking spot). Initialization assigns the first value to that variable (like parking the car)."
