# Week 16 Lesson 2: Final submission checklist (what to turn in)

## Goal
- Submit everything needed for grading
- Provide proof your project runs
- Reflect briefly on what you learned

## What to know
- **Evidence**: Screenshots and sample output that prove features work.
- **Reflection**: Short: what was hard, what you learned, what you’d do next.

## Examples
```csharp
/* Reflection example (3–5 sentences)
I learned how to store objects in a list and search by ID. The hardest part was saving/loading CSV files without crashing. I fixed it by checking File.Exists and validating each line. Next, I would add a nicer menu and allow editing existing records.
*/
```

## Try it
- Make sure your project runs from a fresh start (like the instructor’s computer).
- Collect 2–4 screenshots showing major features.
- Write a short reflection (3–5 sentences).

## Common mistakes
- Forgetting to include screenshots (then we can’t see features).
- Not explaining how to run it (keep it simple).
- Submitting a project that only works with one perfect input (handle invalid input).

## Mini-check
**1) What are 3 things you usually submit for the final?**
