# Week 13 Lab: Persistent To-Do List (file-based)

## Overview
Upgrade your to-do list so it saves to a file and loads when the program starts.

## Requirements checklist (acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Uses a `List<string>` for tasks
- [ ] Loads tasks from a file if it exists
- [ ] Lets user add at least 1 task
- [ ] Saves tasks back to file (WriteAllLines is fine)
- [ ] Prints the updated list
- [ ] Runs without crashing even if file is missing

## Submit to Canvas
- Submit code (paste/export)
- Submit screenshot showing the list saved, then loaded on a second run

## Open in Editor
- Start here: `/editor/?week=13&starter=week-13-lesson-1`

<button data-mark-complete="lab" style="margin-top:12px; padding:10px 14px; border-radius:12px; border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.12); background: rgba(15,23,42,.8); color: #e5e7eb; cursor:pointer;">
