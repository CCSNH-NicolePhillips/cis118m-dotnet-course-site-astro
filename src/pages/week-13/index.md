# Week 13

**Focus:** Files: saving and loading data (so programs remember things).

## This week’s pages
- Lesson 1: [./lesson-1/](./lesson-1/) — <span data-progress-slug="lesson-1"></span>
- Lesson 2: [./lesson-2/](./lesson-2/) — <span data-progress-slug="lesson-2"></span>
- Extra practice: [./extra-practice/](./extra-practice/) — <span data-progress-slug="extra-practice"></span>
- Lab: [./lab/](./lab/) — <span data-progress-slug="lab" data-progress-kind="selfMarked"></span>
- Homework: [./homework/](./homework/) — <span data-progress-slug="homework" data-progress-kind="selfMarked"></span>

## By the end of this week, you can:
- Write text to a file and read it back
- Use simple CSV-style storage (comma-separated values)
- Handle missing files safely

## Open the editor
- `/editor/?week=13&starter=week-13-lesson-1`
