  questions={[
    {
      id: "q1",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is the primary purpose of a namespace in C#?",
      options: [
        "To make the code run faster",
        "To organize code and prevent naming conflicts",
        "To store variables",
        "To print output to the console"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "To organize code and prevent naming conflicts",
      explanation: "Namespaces act like folders for your code, grouping related classes together and preventing conflicts when two classes have the same name."
    },
    {
      id: "q2",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is the correct syntax to declare a namespace called 'MyApp'?",
      options: [
        "namespace = MyApp { }",
        "namespace MyApp { }",
        "class namespace MyApp { }",
        "using MyApp { }"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "namespace MyApp { }",
      explanation: "Namespaces are declared with the 'namespace' keyword followed by the name and curly braces containing the code."
    },
    {
      id: "q3",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What does 'static int Main()' return when a program runs successfully?",
      options: [
        "Nothing (void)",
        "1",
        "0",
        "true"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "0",
      explanation: "By convention, returning 0 from Main indicates successful execution. Non-zero values indicate errors."
    },
    {
      id: "q4",
      type: "true-false",
      question: "The Main method is where program execution begins in a C# application.",
      correctAnswer: "True",
      explanation: "Correct! Main is the entry point - when you run a C# program, the CLR looks for Main and starts executing there."
    },
    {
      id: "q5",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Which of these is the correct XML documentation comment syntax?",
      options: [
        "// This is a summary",
        "/* summary */",
        "/// <summary>This describes the method</summary>",
        "# Summary"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "/// <summary>This describes the method</summary>",
      explanation: "XML documentation uses triple slashes (///) and XML tags like <summary> to create documentation that tools can extract."
    },
    {
      id: "q6",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What is a 'class' in C#?",
      options: [
        "A type of variable",
        "A container that groups related methods and data together",
        "A way to print output",
        "A type of comment"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "A container that groups related methods and data together",
      explanation: "A class is a blueprint that contains methods (actions) and can hold data. It's the fundamental building block of C# programs."
    },
    {
      id: "q7",
      type: "true-false",
      question: "In the Allman brace style, the opening brace { goes on the same line as the statement.",
      correctAnswer: "False",
      explanation: "In Allman style (used in C#), the opening brace goes on its own line. K&R style puts it on the same line."
    },
    {
      id: "q8",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "What happens if you use 'static void Main()' instead of 'static int Main()'?",
      options: [
        "The program won't compile",
        "The program can't use Console.WriteLine",
        "The program doesn't return an exit code",
        "The program runs faster"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "The program doesn't return an exit code",
      explanation: "'void' means the method returns nothing. 'int' means it returns a number (exit code). Both are valid for Main."
    },
    {
      id: "q9",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Why should developers add XML documentation comments to their code?",
      options: [
        "To make the code run faster",
        "To help other developers (and your future self) understand what code does",
        "To prevent compilation errors",
        "To save memory"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "To help other developers (and your future self) understand what code does",
      explanation: "Documentation helps anyone reading your code understand its purpose. IDEs like VS Code also show these comments in tooltips!"
    },
    {
      id: "q10",
      type: "multiple-choice",
      question: "Which keyword is used to indicate that a method belongs to the class itself, not an instance?",
      options: [
        "void",
        "class",
        "static",
        "public"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "static",
      explanation: "The 'static' keyword means the method belongs to the class itself. You don't need to create an object to call it (like Main)."
