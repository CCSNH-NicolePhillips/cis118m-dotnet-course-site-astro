# Week 15 Lesson 2: Final project planning (feature list + acceptance criteria)

## Goal
- Choose a final project idea (small, realistic)
- Write features as checklists
- Define ‘done’ with acceptance criteria

## What to know
- **Feature**: A user-visible capability (Add student, Search, Save).
- **Acceptance criteria**: Clear rules for when the feature counts as complete.
- **MVP**: Minimum viable project: the smallest version that works.

## Examples
```csharp
/* Example project: Roster Manager

MVP Features:
1) Add student
   - [ ] User can enter ID + Name
   - [ ] ID must be unique
   - [ ] Program confirms student added

2) List students
   - [ ] Prints roster in readable format

3) Save/Load
   - [ ] Saves to students.csv
   - [ ] Loads at startup if file exists
*/
```

## Try it
- Pick one: roster manager, to-do app, budget tracker, or inventory tracker.
- Write 4–6 MVP features with acceptance criteria checkboxes.
- Identify which methods/classes you’ll need (sketch it).

## Common mistakes
- Making the final project too big (keep it small and finishable).
- Writing vague criteria like ‘works’ (be specific).
- Skipping save/load planning (then scrambling at the end).

## Mini-check
**1) What’s the purpose of acceptance criteria?**

To define exactly what ‘done’ means so grading is fair and students can self-check.
