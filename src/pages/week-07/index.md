# Week 7

**Focus:** Arrays: storing multiple values in one variable (and using indexes).

## This week’s pages
- Lesson 1: [./lesson-1/](./lesson-1/) — <span data-progress-slug="lesson-1"></span>
- Lesson 2: [./lesson-2/](./lesson-2/) — <span data-progress-slug="lesson-2"></span>
- Extra practice: [./extra-practice/](./extra-practice/) — <span data-progress-slug="extra-practice"></span>
- Lab: [./lab/](./lab/) — <span data-progress-slug="lab" data-progress-kind="selfMarked"></span>
- Homework: [./homework/](./homework/) — <span data-progress-slug="homework" data-progress-kind="selfMarked"></span>

## By the end of this week, you can:
- Create an array and access items by index
- Loop through an array to compute something (sum/average/count)
- Avoid off-by-one errors

## Open the editor
- `/editor/?week=07&starter=week-07-lesson-1`
