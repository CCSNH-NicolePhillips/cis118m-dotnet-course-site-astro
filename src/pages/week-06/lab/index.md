# Week 6 Lab: Refactor into Methods

## Overview
Take a small program and split it into methods so it’s easier to read. Your main program should become short and clean.

## Requirements checklist (acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Program runs without errors
- [ ] Uses at least 3 methods you wrote
- [ ] At least 1 method has parameters
- [ ] At least 1 method returns a value
- [ ] Main program is easy to read (calls methods instead of doing everything inline)

## Submit to Canvas
- Submit code (paste/export)
- Submit a short note (2–3 sentences): what methods you created and why

## Open in Editor
- Start here: `/editor/?week=06&starter=week-06-lesson-1`
