# Week 12 Lab: Crash-Proof Input Program

## Overview
Build a small program that reads user input and does not crash—even when the user types nonsense.

## Requirements checklist (acceptance criteria)
- [ ] Prompts for at least 2 inputs (one number, one string)
- [ ] Validates the number using TryParse (try/catch optional but not required)
- [ ] Uses if/else to handle invalid cases with friendly messages
- [ ] Program continues running to allow retry OR exits cleanly with instructions
- [ ] Runs without crashing

## Submit to Canvas
- Submit code (paste/export)
- Submit screenshot of output showing at least one invalid input handled correctly

## Open in Editor
- Start here: `/editor/?week=12&starter=week-12-lesson-1`

<button data-mark-complete="lab" style="margin-top:12px; padding:10px 14px; border-radius:12px; border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.12); background: rgba(15,23,42,.8); color: #e5e7eb; cursor:pointer;">
  Mark complete
</button>

<div class="hint" style="margin-top:10px;">
