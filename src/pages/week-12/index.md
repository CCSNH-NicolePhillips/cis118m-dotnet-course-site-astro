# Week 12

**Focus:** Reliability: handling errors (try/catch) and thinking like a tester.

## This week’s pages
- Lesson 1: [./lesson-1/](./lesson-1/) — <span data-progress-slug="lesson-1"></span>
- Lesson 2: [./lesson-2/](./lesson-2/) — <span data-progress-slug="lesson-2"></span>
- Extra practice: [./extra-practice/](./extra-practice/) — <span data-progress-slug="extra-practice"></span>
- Lab: [./lab/](./lab/) — <span data-progress-slug="lab" data-progress-kind="selfMarked"></span>
- Homework: [./homework/](./homework/) — <span data-progress-slug="homework" data-progress-kind="selfMarked"></span>

## By the end of this week, you can:
- Use try/catch to prevent crashes and show helpful messages
- Separate ‘compute’ methods from ‘print’ code (testable design)
- Write simple test cases (inputs + expected outputs) for your methods
