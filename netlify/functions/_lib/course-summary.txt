Quiz Questions (9 questions):
1. Q: What is C#?
   A: A programming language
   Why: C# is the programming language you write. .NET is the platform that runs it.
2. Q: What does Console.WriteLine do?
   A: Prints a line of text to the console
   Why: Yes, statements in C# end with semicolons.
3. Q: Which is the correct way to create a string variable?
   A: string name = \
   Why: String variables need quotes around the text. The type (string) comes first, then the name, then = and the value.
4. Q: What will this code print? int age = 20; Console.WriteLine(age + 5);
   A: 25
   Why: The code does the math (20 + 5 = 25) and prints the result.
5. Q: What's wrong with this code? string city = Boston;
   A: Missing quotes around Boston
   Why: String values must be in quotes: string city = \
6. Q: Which is an example of string interpolation?
   A: Console.WriteLine($\
   Why: String interpolation uses $ before the quote and {} around variables.
7. Q: You can do math with string variables.
   A: False
   Why: False. Math works with numbers (int, double, etc.), not strings. With strings, + concatenates (glues together) instead of adding.
8. Q: What will this print? string x = \
   A: 510
   Why: When you use + with strings, it concatenates (glues) them together: \
9. Q: Which of these is a good variable name?
   A: firstName
   Why: firstName uses camelCase and is descriptive. The others have errors: spaces aren't allowed, can't start with a number, and class is a reserved keyword.

Quiz Questions (12 questions):
1. Q: What is C# in the .NET ecosystem?
   A: The programming language you write code in
   Why: C# is the programming language — the 'blueprint' you write. The CLR is the 'engine' that executes it.
2. Q: What does the CLR (Common Language Runtime) do?
   A: Executes your compiled code at runtime
   Why: The CLR is the 'engine' that actually runs your compiled code. It manages memory, security, and execution.
3. Q: A missing semicolon in C# will cause a compile-time error, preventing the CLR from ever running the code.
   A: True
   Why: Correct! The compiler catches syntax errors like missing semicolons BEFORE the CLR ever sees your code.
4. Q: What is the purpose of Console.WriteLine()?
   A: To display output to the terminal/console
   Why: Console.WriteLine() is your communication protocol — it sends messages to the terminal for the user to see.
5. Q: In the 'Blueprint vs Engine' analogy, what does the semicolon represent?
   A: A signal that one instruction is complete
   Why: The semicolon tells the compiler 'this statement is finished' — like a period at the end of a sentence.
6. Q: What does the BCL (Base Class Library) provide?
   A: Pre-built classes for common tasks like File I/O and Collections
   Why: The BCL is your 'toolbox' — thousands of pre-built classes so you don't have to write everything from scratch.
7. Q: What does the Roslyn compiler produce when it compiles your C# code?
   A: Intermediate Language (IL) that any .NET runtime can execute
   Why: Roslyn compiles C# to IL (Intermediate Language). The JIT compiler then translates IL to native code at runtime.
8. Q: When does the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler run?
   A: At runtime, when the program actually executes
   Why: The JIT compiler runs at execution time, translating IL to native machine code for your specific CPU.
9. Q: Console applications require a graphical user interface (GUI) to run.
   A: False
   Why: Console applications run in a terminal/command line — no GUI required. They're lightweight and great for learning.
10. Q: What is wrong with this code: Console.WriteLine(Hello World);
   A: Missing double quotes around the text
   Why: String literals (text) must be wrapped in double quotes: Console.WriteLine(\
11. Q: Which email should you use for technical help in this course?
   A: MCCCISOnline1@ccsnh.edu
   Why: For technical questions and course support, email MCCCISOnline1@ccsnh.edu.
12. Q: When is the hard deadline for weekly missions?
   A: Sunday at 11:59 PM
   Why: Weekly assignments are due Sunday at 11:59 PM. Late submissions may have point deductions.

Quiz Questions (10 questions):
1. Q: What is the primary purpose of a namespace in C#?
   A: To organize code and prevent naming conflicts
   Why: Namespaces act like folders for your code, grouping related classes together and preventing conflicts when two classes have the same name.
2. Q: What is the correct syntax to declare a namespace called 'MyApp'?
   A: namespace MyApp { }
   Why: Namespaces are declared with the 'namespace' keyword followed by the name and curly braces containing the code.
3. Q: What does 'static int Main()' return when a program runs successfully?
   A: 0
   Why: By convention, returning 0 from Main indicates successful execution. Non-zero values indicate errors.
4. Q: The Main method is where program execution begins in a C# application.
   A: True
   Why: Correct! Main is the entry point - when you run a C# program, the CLR looks for Main and starts executing there.
5. Q: Which of these is the correct XML documentation comment syntax?
   A: /// <summary>This describes the method</summary>
   Why: XML documentation uses triple slashes (///) and XML tags like <summary> to create documentation that tools can extract.
6. Q: What is a 'class' in C#?
   A: A container that groups related methods and data together
   Why: A class is a blueprint that contains methods (actions) and can hold data. It's the fundamental building block of C# programs.
7. Q: In the Allman brace style, the opening brace { goes on the same line as the statement.
   A: False
   Why: In Allman style (used in C#), the opening brace goes on its own line. K&R style puts it on the same line.
8. Q: What happens if you use 'static void Main()' instead of 'static int Main()'?
   A: The program doesn't return an exit code
   Why: 'void' means the method returns nothing. 'int' means it returns a number (exit code). Both are valid for Main.
9. Q: Why should developers add XML documentation comments to their code?
   A: To help other developers (and your future self) understand what code does
   Why: Documentation helps anyone reading your code understand its purpose. IDEs like VS Code also show these comments in tooltips!
10. Q: Which keyword is used to indicate that a method belongs to the class itself, not an instance?
   A: static
   Why: The 'static' keyword means the method belongs to the class itself. You don't need to create an object to call it (like Main).

Quiz Questions (10 questions):
1. Q: Which keyword makes a variable unchangeable after it is set?
   A: const
   Why: The 'const' keyword creates a compile-time constant that cannot be modified after declaration.
2. Q: What is the default value of a bool if not initialized?
   A: false
   Why: In C#, uninitialized boolean fields default to 'false'.
3. Q: Which type is best for storing a single letter like 'A'?
   A: char
   Why: The 'char' type is specifically designed to store a single Unicode character.
4. Q: Can an int store the value 10.5?
   A: No, it causes a compiler error
   Why: An int cannot store decimal values. Attempting to assign 10.5 to an int causes a compiler error because of implicit conversion restrictions.
5. Q: In the line `int x = 5;`, what is 'x' called?
   A: The identifier
   Why: The identifier is the name given to the variable. In this statement, 'int' is the type, 'x' is the identifier, '=' is the assignment operator, and '5' is the value.
6. Q: Why should you use 'decimal' instead of 'double' for currency?
   A: decimal avoids binary floating-point rounding errors
   Why: The decimal type uses base-10 internally, avoiding the rounding errors that occur with binary floating-point (double) when representing decimal fractions like 0.1.
7. Q: What suffix is required when assigning a decimal literal?
   A: m (e.g., 45.99m)
   Why: The 'm' suffix tells C# that the number should be treated as a decimal type. Without it, 45.99 is interpreted as a double.
8. Q: What does 'string immutability' mean?
   A: Strings cannot be changed after creation
   Why: Immutability means once a string object is created in memory, it cannot be modified. Any operation that appears to change a string actually creates a new string.
9. Q: Which variable name is INVALID in C#?
   A: 2ndAttempt
   Why: Variable names cannot start with a number. '2ndAttempt' would cause a compiler error. Valid alternatives include 'secondAttempt' or '_2ndAttempt'.
10. Q: What is the difference between declaration and initialization?
   A: Declaration reserves memory; initialization assigns a value
   Why: Declaration creates the variable and reserves memory (like reserving a parking spot). Initialization assigns the first value to that variable (like parking the car).

    }

    public BankAccount(double startingBalance)
    {
        if (startingBalance < 0) startingBalance = 0;
        Balance = startingBalance;
    }

    public void Deposit(double amount)
    {
