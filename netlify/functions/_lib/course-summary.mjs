Q: What is C#?\n   A: A programming language\n   Why: C# is the programming language you write. .NET is the platform that runs it.\n2. Q: What does Console.WriteLine do?\n   A: Prints a line of text to the console\n   Why: Yes, statements in C# end with semicolons.\n3. Q: Which is the correct way to create a string variable?\n   A: string name = \\\n   Why: String variables need quotes around the text. The type (string) comes first, then the name, then = and the value.\n4. Q: What will this code print? int age = 20; Console.WriteLine(age + 5);\n   A: 25\n   Why: The code does the math (20 + 5 = 25) and prints the result.\n5. Q: What's wrong with this code? string city = Boston;\n   A: Missing quotes around Boston\n   Why: String values must be in quotes: string city = \\\n6. Q: Which is an example of string interpolation?\n   A: Console.WriteLine($\\\n   Why: String interpolation uses $ before the quote and {} around variables.\n7. Q: You can do math with string variables.\n   A: False\n   Why: False. Math works with numbers (int, double, etc.), not strings. With strings, + concatenates (glues together) instead of adding.\n8. Q: What will this print? string x = \\\n   A: 510\n   Why: When you use + with strings, it concatenates (glues) them together: \\\n9. Q: Which of these is a good variable name?\n   A: firstName\n   Why: firstName uses camelCase and is descriptive. The others have errors: spaces aren't allowed, can't start with a number, and class is a reserved keyword.\n\n### 📚 Overview: Week 01 • Extra Practice\nKey Concepts:\n- Time: 25 minutes\n- Example comment:\n- Challenge:\n\nSummary: # Week 1 Extra Practice **Time: 25 minutes** These are quick micro-drills to reinforce what you learned in Lessons 1 and 2.

Q: What is C# in the .NET ecosystem?\n   A: The programming language you write code in\n   Why: C# is the programming language — the 'blueprint' you write. The CLR is the 'engine' that executes it.\n2. Q: What does the CLR (Common Language Runtime) do?\n   A: Executes your compiled code at runtime\n   Why: The CLR is the 'engine' that actually runs your compiled code. It manages memory, security, and execution.\n3. Q: A missing semicolon in C# will cause a compile-time error, preventing the CLR from ever running the code.\n   A: True\n   Why: Correct! The compiler catches syntax errors like missing semicolons BEFORE the CLR ever sees your code.\n4. Q: What is the purpose of Console.WriteLine()?\n   A: To display output to the terminal/console\n   Why: Console.WriteLine() is your communication protocol — it sends messages to the terminal for the user to see.\n5. Q: In the 'Blueprint vs Engine' analogy, what does the semicolon represent?\n   A: A signal that one instruction is complete\n   Why: The semicolon tells the compiler 'this statement is finished' — like a period at the end of a sentence.\n6. Q: What does the BCL (Base Class Library) provide?\n   A: Pre-built classes for common tasks like File I/O and Collections\n   Why: The BCL is your 'toolbox' — thousands of pre-built classes so you don't have to write everything from scratch.\n7. Q: What does the Roslyn compiler produce when it compiles your C# code?\n   A: Intermediate Language (IL) that any .NET runtime can execute\n   Why: Roslyn compiles C# to IL (Intermediate Language). The JIT compiler then translates IL to native code at runtime.\n8. Q: When does the JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler run?\n   A: At runtime, when the program actually executes\n   Why: The JIT compiler runs at execution time, translating IL to native machine code for your specific CPU.\n9. Q: Console applications require a graphical user interface (GUI) to run.\n   A: False\n   Why: Console applications run in a terminal/command line — no GUI required. They're lightweight and great for learning.\n10. Q: What is wrong with this code: Console.WriteLine(Hello World);\n   A: Missing double quotes around the text\n   Why: String literals (text) must be wrapped in double quotes: Console.WriteLine(\\\n11. Q: Which email should you use for technical help in this course?\n   A: MCCCISOnline1@ccsnh.edu\n   Why: For technical questions and course support, email MCCCISOnline1@ccsnh.edu.\n12. Q: When is the hard deadline for weekly missions?\n   A: Sunday at 11:59 PM\n   Why: Weekly assignments are due Sunday at 11:59 PM. Late submissions may have point deductions.\n\n---\n\n## Week 2: Your First C# Program - Namespaces, Classes, and Main\n\n### 📖 Lesson: Section 2.1 • Namespaces & Classes\nKey Concepts:\n- namespace\n- millions\n- architectural blueprint\n\nSummary: # Section 2.1: Namespaces & Classes 📦 Structural Foundation ⏱️ Estimated Time: 20 minutes --- ✦ C# Namespaces: The City Zoning Map for Your Code Think of your code as a growing city.

Q: What is the primary purpose of a namespace in C#?\n   A: To organize code and prevent naming conflicts\n   Why: Namespaces act like folders for your code, grouping related classes together and preventing conflicts when two classes have the same name.\n2. Q: What is the correct syntax to declare a namespace called 'MyApp'?\n   A: namespace MyApp { }\n   Why: Namespaces are declared with the 'namespace' keyword followed by the name and curly braces containing the code.\n3. Q: What does 'static int Main()' return when a program runs successfully?\n   A: 0\n   Why: By convention, returning 0 from Main indicates successful execution. Non-zero values indicate errors.\n4. Q: The Main method is where program execution begins in a C# application.\n   A: True\n   Why: Correct! Main is the entry point - when you run a C# program, the CLR looks for Main and starts executing there.\n5. Q: Which of these is the correct XML documentation comment syntax?\n   A: /// <summary>This describes the method</summary>\n   Why: XML documentation uses triple slashes (///) and XML tags like <summary> to create documentation that tools can extract.\n6. Q: What is a 'class' in C#?\n   A: A container that groups related methods and data together\n   Why: A class is a blueprint that contains methods (actions) and can hold data. It's the fundamental building block of C# programs.\n7. Q: In the Allman brace style, the opening brace { goes on the same line as the statement.\n   A: False\n   Why: In Allman style (used in C#), the opening brace goes on its own line. K&R style puts it on the same line.\n8. Q: What happens if you use 'static void Main()' instead of 'static int Main()'?\n   A: The program doesn't return an exit code\n   Why: 'void' means the method returns nothing. 'int' means it returns a number (exit code). Both are valid for Main.\n9. Q: Why should developers add XML documentation comments to their code?\n   A: To help other developers (and your future self) understand what code does\n   Why: Documentation helps anyone reading your code understand its purpose. IDEs like VS Code also show these comments in tooltips!\n10. Q: Which keyword is used to indicate that a method belongs to the class itself, not an instance?\n   A: static\n   Why: The 'static' keyword means the method belongs to the class itself. You don't need to create an object to call it (like Main).\n\n---\n\n## Week 3: Variables & Data Types\n\n### 📚 Overview: Section 3.1 • Declaring State\nKey Concepts:\n- variable\n\nSummary: # Section 3.1: Declaring State 🧠 Variables & Memory ⏱️ Estimated Time: 25 minutes --- ✦ The Memory Grid: Variables as 'Parking Spots' Every variable you create in C# is a reserved parking spot in your computer's RAM.

Q: Which keyword makes a variable unchangeable after it is set?\n   A: const\n   Why: The 'const' keyword creates a compile-time constant that cannot be modified after declaration.\n2. Q: What is the default value of a bool if not initialized?\n   A: false\n   Why: In C#, uninitialized boolean fields default to 'false'.\n3. Q: Which type is best for storing a single letter like 'A'?\n   A: char\n   Why: The 'char' type is specifically designed to store a single Unicode character.\n4. Q: Can an int store the value 10.5?\n   A: No, it causes a compiler error\n   Why: An int cannot store decimal values. Attempting to assign 10.5 to an int causes a compiler error because of implicit conversion restrictions.\n5. Q: In the line `int x = 5;`, what is 'x' called?\n   A: The identifier\n   Why: The identifier is the name given to the variable. In this statement, 'int' is the type, 'x' is the identifier, '=' is the assignment operator, and '5' is the value.\n6. Q: Why should you use 'decimal' instead of 'double' for currency?\n   A: decimal avoids binary floating-point rounding errors\n   Why: The decimal type uses base-10 internally, avoiding the rounding errors that occur with binary floating-point (double) when representing decimal fractions like 0.1.\n7. Q: What suffix is required when assigning a decimal literal?\n   A: m (e.g., 45.99m)\n   Why: The 'm' suffix tells C# that the number should be treated as a decimal type. Without it, 45.99 is interpreted as a double.\n8. Q: What does 'string immutability' mean?\n   A: Strings cannot be changed after creation\n   Why: Immutability means once a string object is created in memory, it cannot be modified. Any operation that appears to change a string actually creates a new string.\n9. Q: Which variable name is INVALID in C#?\n   A: 2ndAttempt\n   Why: Variable names cannot start with a number. '2ndAttempt' would cause a compiler error. Valid alternatives include 'secondAttempt' or '_2ndAttempt'.\n10.
